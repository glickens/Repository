            <h2>My Avatar Represents Leadership from Judging by the Image. </h2>
            <article>
                <h3>My avatar represents what I believe in.</h3>

                <p>
                    My avatar is possibly of the President of the United States. I believe my avatar is either of
                    President Obama, or Joe Biden.
                    I tried to determine exactly who the avatar was exactly, without making myself look dumb.
                    So, I looked up the avatar name, "BigCountry" online, but it returned
                    some rock band that did not look nothing like my chosen avatar. I do not know, maybe I am missing
                    something here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I assume by the shape of my avitar that it might be a figure of either Obama, or Biden. My avitar is
                    wearing
                    a suit and tie as if it is a businness man, or a politician ready to be the leader of a great
                    country. The avitar is posed as if it
                    is superman, "Clark Kent", the well dressed news reporter ready to strip out of the suit and tie to
                    reveal a superhero outfit
                    underneath.

            <h2>I Guess I will Accept the Image as is.</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>I christen the avatar, "Obama"!!</h3>
                <p>Here are a few more resaons why I accepted it as Obama:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I gave up guessing.</li>
                    <li>Well, it's shaped like Obama.</li>
                    <li>Only Obama can rock a block shaped head.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I even thought about sending a picture to my kids since they are well versed at avitar figures,
                    however, I did not want my
                    kids to think their dad is slow when it comes to an image, something that might be obvious to them
                    and others their age.
                    I'm feeling kind of confident that It is obama though, if not the image is just going to have to
                    live with with it, lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The avitar has a head shaped like block. I noticed that Obama also has a head shaped like a block.
                    Well, then again Biden also has
                    a head that is shaped like a block. A true delima that requires the assistance of Scottland Yard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have desires to create popular application or website that would revolutionize the way humanity
                    interacts with eachother.
                    Because revolution and change are the master keys towards a new and enhanced existence.

            <h2>Show the Avatar to People at the Bar.</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>To be 150% sure I will take my avitar for a drink at the bar.</h3>
                <p>
                    So, heare I am at the local bar with one mission on my mind. That mission is confirm that I am good
                    when it comes to guessing
                    images. I go around asking people who they think the avitar resembles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe I must have asked about fifteen people in the bar to identify the image. By the time I was
                    done I was looked upon as if
                    I was a mental patient who just excaped from the ward. The embarassment was just too overwhelming,
                    so I decided to secretly leave the place
                    through a back door. My curiosity is no longer an adventure, Obama it is, and Obama it will always
                    be!!

    <p>This is a picture of Airforce One. Airforce one flew President Kennedy who became
        the very first president to be a passenger on Airforce One in 1962. This
        famous plane has transported the most powerful individuals in America since then.

    <p>Navigating through the airport is a thing of the past when you are elected as the president.
        Presidents have enjoyed the luxury of boarding a plane without having to go through checkpoints
        or gates. Also Airforce One is built for comfort and safety. Getting on the plane is on my bucket list.

    <p>The man; the myth, its a drawing of Obama. Someone took the time to artistically draw the president.
        A true artist never forgets the details required to achieve perfection.

    <p>Tough questions leads to strange facial expressions. A reporter asked Obama a tough question
        on abortion and the rights of the LGBT community. These questions left the president speechless.

    <p>I want to invent new innovative things with my ideas like Obama did with Obama Care. Since it's
        inception this plan has helped healthcare to become available to all Americans.
